### ✅ Merged Pull Requests

**1. Improve Documentation for Dataset APIs**

[![Fix misleading add_column() usage example in docstring](https://pr-req-io.vercel.app/api/badge?title=Fix%20misleading%20add_column()%20usage%20example%20in%20docstring&repo=huggingface%2Fdatasets&number=7648&status=MERGED&author=ArjunJagdale&theme=modern)](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/7648)

🔹 Identified and corrected misleading docstrings for core methods like `add_column`, `select`, and `filter`, which return new datasets instead of modifying them in-place.

🔹 Prevented potential bugs caused by misunderstanding dataset immutability by updating five+ key method examples.

✅ Improves developer onboarding and API correctness across Hugging Face datasets.

**2. Raise Explicit Error in Folder-Based Dataset Loader**

[![fix: raise error in FolderBasedBuilder when data_dir and data_files are missing ](https://pr-req-io.vercel.app/api/badge?title=fix%3A%20raise%20error%20in%20FolderBasedBuilder%20when%20data_dir%20and%20data_files%20are%20missing%20&repo=huggingface%2Fdatasets&number=7623&status=MERGED&author=ArjunJagdale&theme=modern)](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/7623)

🔹 Solved a critical UX issue where calling `load_dataset("audiofolder")` without specifying `data_dir` led to unexpected behavior and long load times.

🔹 Added explicit error validation in `FolderBasedBuilder._info()` to enforce correct usage.

📂 Affects all folder-based loaders like `audiofolder`, `imagefolder`, reducing silent failures and improving robustness.

**3. Refactor Config Defaults to Avoid Shared Mutable State**

[![refactor(config): replace get_empty_str_list with CONSTANT.copy in ParquetAndInfoConfig (#1522) ](https://pr-req-io.vercel.app/api/badge?title=refactor(config)%3A%20replace%20get_empty_str_list%20with%20CONSTANT.copy%20in%20ParquetAndInfoConfig%20(%231522)%20&repo=huggingface%2Fdataset-viewer&number=3219&status=MERGED&author=ArjunJagdale&theme=modern)](https://github.com/huggingface/dataset-viewer/pull/3219)

🔹 Refactored internal `ParquetAndInfoConfig` logic to eliminate shared mutable defaults in dataclass fields.

🔹 Ensured safe and predictable behavior in config initialization across multiple jobs in `orchestrator.py`.

🧼 Passed all CI checks, Ruff formatting, and Hugging Face’s `poetry` build standards.

**4. Add Unit Tests for Core Caching Utility**

[![test: add unit tests for get_previous_step_or_raise (#1908) ](https://pr-req-io.vercel.app/api/badge?title=test%3A%20add%20unit%20tests%20for%20get_previous_step_or_raise%20(%231908)%20&repo=huggingface%2Fdataset-viewer&number=3218&status=MERGED&author=ArjunJagdale&theme=modern)](https://github.com/huggingface/dataset-viewer/pull/3218)

🔹 Designed and implemented comprehensive tests for cache retrieval and error handling in `get_previous_step_or_raise`.

🔹 Covered scenarios including cache hits, misses, and corrupted responses using internal testing utilities (`upsert_response`, etc).

🧪 Strengthened the dataset caching layer’s reliability in production workflows.

**5. Simplify Gated Dataset Setup using `HfApi.update_repo_settings`**

[![refactor(tests): use HfApi.update_repo_settings to simplify gated dataset test setup ](https://pr-req-io.vercel.app/api/badge?title=refactor(tests)%3A%20use%20HfApi.update_repo_settings%20to%20simplify%20gated%20dataset%20test%20setup%20&repo=huggingface%2Fdataset-viewer&number=3206&status=MERGED&author=ArjunJagdale&theme=modern)](https://github.com/huggingface/dataset-viewer/pull/3206)

🔹 Replaced legacy helper functions with Hugging Face Hub's official API for enabling gated dataset settings.

🔹 Removed over 220+ lines of redundant code across 3 test modules while preserving test integrity.

✅ Resulted in cleaner, more maintainable tests aligned with the latest SDK capabilities.

**6. Add support for Date features in Croissant schema**

[![ Add support for Date features in Croissant schema](https://pr-req-io.vercel.app/api/badge?title=%20Add%20support%20for%20Date%20features%20in%20Croissant%20schema&repo=huggingface%2Fdataset-viewer&number=3223&status=MERGED&author=ArjunJagdale&theme=modern)](https://github.com/huggingface/dataset-viewer/pull/3223)

🔹 This PR adds support for datasets.features.Date in the Croissant schema generation.

🔹 Fields like Date, UTCDate, and UTCTime (e.g., in Lichess/standard-chess-games) will now be correctly included in the generated spec.
