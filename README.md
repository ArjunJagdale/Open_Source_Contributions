## 🧾 Contribution Summary: Fixing Duplicate Sidebar Entry in MLflow GenAI Docs

### 📂 **File Access & Purpose**

* **Target File:** `docs/sidebarsGenAI.ts`
* **Purpose:** Defines the sidebar structure for the **GenAI section** of the MLflow documentation, powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

---

### 🎯 **Problem Identified**

* The **"Tracing" category** under `"Getting Started 🚀"` used:

  ```ts
  {
    type: 'autogenerated',
    dirName: 'getting-started/tracing',
  }
  ```

* This caused the `index.mdx` to appear **twice** in the sidebar:

  * Once as an autogenerated entry
  * Again as a manually linked category with a `link.id`

* ✅ Resulting in **duplicated “Tracing” entries**, which broke sidebar clarity and user experience.

---

### 🛠️ **What I Did**

1. Located and understood the sidebar config in `docs/sidebarsGenAI.ts`.
2. Replaced the problematic `autogenerated` entry with explicit `doc` links:

   ```ts
   {
     type: 'doc',
     id: 'getting-started/tracing/tracing-notebook',
   },
   {
     type: 'doc',
     id: 'getting-started/tracing/tracing-ide',
   }
   ```
3. Kept the index page manually linked via:

   ```ts
   link: {
     type: 'doc',
     id: 'getting-started/tracing/index',
   }
   ```
4. Ran the **Docusaurus dev server locally** using `npm run start` to:

   * ✅ Confirm only one “Tracing” appears
   * ✅ Ensure all links are functional
