# Contribution 1: Fixing Duplicate Sidebar Entry in MLflow GenAI Docs

### 📂 **File Access & Purpose**

* **Target File:** `docs/sidebarsGenAI.ts`
* **Purpose:** Defines the sidebar structure for the **GenAI section** of the MLflow documentation, powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

---

### 🎯 **Problem Identified**

* The **"Tracing" category** under `"Getting Started 🚀"` used:

  ```ts
  {
    type: 'autogenerated',
    dirName: 'getting-started/tracing',
  }
  ```

* This caused the `index.mdx` to appear **twice** in the sidebar:

  * Once as an autogenerated entry
  * Again as a manually linked category with a `link.id`

* ✅ Resulting in **duplicated “Tracing” entries**, which broke sidebar clarity and user experience.

---

### 🛠️ **What I Did**

1. Located and understood the sidebar config in `docs/sidebarsGenAI.ts`.
2. Replaced the problematic `autogenerated` entry with explicit `doc` links:

   ```ts
   {
     type: 'doc',
     id: 'getting-started/tracing/tracing-notebook',
   },
   {
     type: 'doc',
     id: 'getting-started/tracing/tracing-ide',
   }
   ```
3. Kept the index page manually linked via:

   ```ts
   link: {
     type: 'doc',
     id: 'getting-started/tracing/index',
   }
   ```
4. Ran the **Docusaurus dev server locally** using `npm run start` to:

   * ✅ Confirm only one “Tracing” appears
   * ✅ Ensure all links are functional

### 🧾 **Files/Technologies Involved**

* 📄 **File Modified:** `docs/sidebarsGenAI.ts`
* 🧠 **Tooling:** Docusaurus config format (JavaScript/TypeScript-like)
* 📁 **Docs Directory:** `docs/gen-ai-docs/getting-started/tracing/`
* 🧪 **Testing:** Local server preview

# Contribution 2: Clarifying `mlflow.log_artifacts()` Behavior in Tracking API Docs

### 📂 **File Access & Purpose**

* **Target File:** `mlflow/docs/docs/classic-ml/tracking/tracking-api/index.mdx`
* **Purpose:** Updates the **Tracking API reference table** to more accurately describe the usage of `mlflow.log_artifacts()` in MLflow documentation.

---

### 🎯 **Problem Identified**

* The API table listed:

  ```md
  | <APILink fn="mlflow.log_artifacts" /> | Log entire directory | `mlflow.log_artifacts("./plots/")` |
  ```

* ❗ This entry was misleading, as `mlflow.log_artifacts()` **only supports directories** — **not single files**.

* This led to **confusion among users** trying to log a file (e.g., `mlflow.log_artifacts("file.txt")`), which results in **no effect or an empty list** because the function internally depends on `os.walk()`.

---

### 🛠️ **What I Did**

1. Reviewed the function definition in the source code:

   ```python
   def log_artifacts(local_dir: str, ...)
   ```

2. Verified behavior through testing and `os.walk()` output.

3. Updated the docs table to clarify the expected input and prevent incorrect usage:

   ```md
   | <APILink fn="mlflow.log_artifacts" /> | Log all files in a directory (**not for single files**) | `mlflow.log_artifacts("./plots/")` |
   ```

4. Submitted a Pull Request with the fix and filled in the standard MLflow PR template.

5. Responded to maintainer feedback and ensured the formatting followed contribution guidelines.

### 🧾 **Files/Technologies Involved**

* 📄 **File Modified:** `index.mdx` inside MLflow's Tracking API docs
* 🧠 **Tooling:** Docusaurus (Markdown, MDX format), GitHub PR workflow
* 🧪 **Testing:** Manual verification of rendered table and function input behavior
